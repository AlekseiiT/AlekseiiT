ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aleksey!

I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer with a passion for Automated Testing. My journey in the world of software testing has led me to explore various technologies and tools, including Java, Maven, Selenium, TestNG, REST Assured, and architectural patterns like OOP, Page Object Model (POM), Factories, Reporting, Data-Driven Testing (DDT), and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). I'm constantly striving to deepen my knowledge and expertise in the field of Automated Quality Assurance.

If you're curious about what I'm up to or want to explore my projects, I encourage you to take a closer look at the pinned **<a href="https://github.com/AlekseiiT/CucumberProject" target="_blank">Cucumber Test Framework</a>**. Feel free to check it out and get in touch if you have any questions or ideas to share! âœ¨
